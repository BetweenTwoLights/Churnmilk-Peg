# PRIMARY IDEAS/ DETAILS

- possible titles: 
	- The Lawn-Keeper
	- The Vines
	- Lawn Mowing Simulator 2048
- Primary goal: maintain a large swathe of fast-growing grass
- initially planned to just be "keep up with a lot of grass" but actually making it a horror thing might be more interesting
- top-down 2D or maybe 3D-ish
- main gameplay things:
	- survival 
	- crafting
	- exploration
	- upgrade trees
	- automation
# THEMES/VIBES
- game takes place on an alien planet
- horror vibes; the grass is scary somehow
- might be 8 bit graphics (bc idk how to do anything else lol)
- there is no winning, only expanding. cookie clicker-esque game loop
- post-apocalyptic?
# LORE
- you were sent on a mission to a grassy planet to explore and help set up human civilization
- turns out, the grass is NOT harmless. extremely aggressive
	- two ways to satisfy this plot point:
	1. no one knew how dangerous it was
	2. they DID know, and it was intentionally a suicide mission.
- the grass is the only organism on the planet; its so good at grassing that it choked out all other life on the planet
- MAYBE: there once WAS intelligent life on the planet, but it was consumed by the grass. can find scraps of an advanced society 
- POSSIBLE LORE IDEA: grass consumption
	- you have to eat grass to survive
	- the grass eventually grows to consume you from the inside
	- this is a cool concept but would be hard to like. survive
# GAME MECHANICS
## starting the game
- ship lands on the planet safely, incinerating the grass around the ship. (temporary safety against the grass, but within a week or so, will grow again)
## the main base
- this is the only sanctuary;  allows the player to rest + refuel + craft
- can be destroyed by vines if the surrounding grass isnt maintained 
## crafting
- main method of upgrading gear
- resources can be found in the grass
- some things include grass as an ingredient
	- maybe ship has a 'disinfectant', turn vines into usable material
	- using live vines is dangerous, theyll keep growing
## "The Grass"
- has a variety of alive-ness levels: 
	1. established; takes much effort to destroy
	2. young; easily destroyed
	3. saplings; still dangerous,
	4. hacked; regrows fast
	5. mowed; takes a couple minutes to grow back
	6. tilled; takes much longer to recover
	7. incinerated; takes a very long time to grow back
- NEVER fully gone; will always recover over time
	- might introduce a late-game way to establish permanent no-grass zones? will be very expensive though
- the grass always tries to advance to the tier above it (mostly)
	- incinerated advances to either 'fertile soil' or saplings
	- tilled advances to saplings
	- mowed advances to hacked 
	- hacked advances to young grass
	- saplings advance to young grass
	- young grass eventually advances to established grass
	- **not final**, just an idea of how grass might work 
- GRASS GROWS FASTER IF ITS SURROUNDED BY MORE GRASS
## mowing
- upgrade chain: 
	1. machete 
		- hack through the grass
		- 1 tile at a time, with a long cooldown 
		- 1 or 2 swings for a single tile?
		- assembled from resources available on/around ship
	2. scythe
		- more efficiently chop down grass
		- 1 or 2 tiles, with a much shorter cooldown
	3. manual old-school push lawnmower
		- virtually no cooldown, fully automatic
		- still only 1 tile and pretty slow/exhausting tho
	4. motorized push lawnmower 
		- lower energy cost, but still costly
		- also costs FUEL, harder to find
	5. riding lawnmower
		- virtually 0 energy cost, and defends against the vines; no immediate risk
		- can be damaged by rocks?
	6. tractor
		- similar to lawnmower, BUT much wider range and much faster (3 or 5 tiles wide)
		- consumes fuel more quickly (but still efficient)
- tilling is also a mechanic maybe
	- upgrade chain:
		1. hoe 
		2. tiny push-tiller thingy
		3. tractor upgrade for tilling 
	- you can only till saplings and already weak plants; cant till established or young grass. maybe hacked?
- flamethrower also useful?
	- im torn on this mechanic, and how itll be useful 
	- itll either be underpowered or completely OP
	- it cant just be an insta-win, thats no fun. 2 possibilities to nerf it:
		1. if the wilderness is flamethrower-ed, it is somehow ineffective; grass is resistant
			- maybe the flame is only effective on small sections? only small flames effective
			- grass can resist larger flames, hardens or something.
		2. if flamethrown, fire spreads quickly, eliminating the grass but also possibly harming the player from the smoke?
	- most effective method against it is sectioning part of it off for burning
	- tilled soil provides barrier for fire?
	- incineration also has some drawbacks or something
## automation
- eventually unlock automated lawnmowers
- THEY CAN HURT YOU
- possible idea: rotating laser which keeps a circular area mowed, but the laser also just kills you
- roomba-like autoloawn-mowers, but they can also just run you over
	- dumb roombas and smart roombas:
	1. dumb roomba- follows a designated path and keeps a set area clear. stay out of its way.
	2. smart roomba - more efficient, and can clear a larger area. seeks out grass near its main station and hunts it down
		- it's motion activated; if you approach it will just kill you. watch out
- you have to be very careful with anything automated
## losing the game
- player loses when consumed by the grass
- also lose by letting the grass get too close to base; vines will eventually consume it
- can also maybe starve or something, idk if there will be hunger mechanics and such
## fencing
- idk if this will be a game mechanic but it has potential
- once an area has been tilled/ incinerated, fences can be established around it 
- fences can keep out the grass, but get damaged over time
- if 1 fence tile breaks, grass will rapidly spread through the area. which is bad

## cultivation
- can eventually breed the grass for certain traits, to make it useful
	- ex. crafting grass, sturdier and useful for tools
	- eating grass, doesnt kill you
## exploration
- can travel farther from base to find rarer resources
- eventually find like, ancient scraps or something
- you can carve a path through the grass, but it will regrow
- if you run out of fuel on the way there (for gas-vehicles, etc.) you can get stranded (scawy)
- exploration unlocks more materials, such as fuel and metal and such
