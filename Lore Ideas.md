# Game Lore Overview
## You Are the Invading Alien
- We destroyed planet earth and you're on a mission to make this new planet we've found suitable for human life
- Both sides of this game are representations of fascism:
  1. Humanity has basically killed it's planet and crippled its own species in doing so.  So basically, to this planet, we're the terrifying invading aliens that ruined our planet and have come to colonize this new one
  2. This Kudzu planet has no diversity of life - there's some micro-organisms, but mostly the surface is covered by the body and appendages of one Mega-Flora entity that has choked out all other life
  3. You must become the revolutionary that fights for diversity of life because it's the only way to save humanity and this new planet from the Earthlings and the Kudzu that has taken it over before you've arrived

## Look Into:
- Kudzu, both the plant that really exists and mythology that the name comes from
- player character name is Peggy?  and acts as the goblin guarding the grove they're in charge of so that diversity of life can flourish and a true renewal of the new planet and Earthlings can take place

## Ideas that I want to represent in mechanics but am not sure how yet:
- research into life, biology, and planet itself in its system
- gene manipulation and using other advanced techniques and technology to essentially "re-wild" this planet by editing dna of extinct species on this new planet with other animals that we've "saved" from our own planet that we've destroyed and left behind us - sort like Jurassic park style where they marry preserved DNA with the egg of a current, living breed of frogs but doing that with all sorts of creatures
  - this would mean that the tech tree and advancement within the game is a lot of biology-based advancements rather than the quick, sleek, easy technology that the rest of the Earthlings are expecting from you
  - Also get some gross vibes from the act of having to "order" different kinds of animals to be delivered, kind of like you were, as a product in frozen stasis for you to manipulate for your own purposes
- exploring the remnants of a long-dead civilization of intelligent creatures similar to humans and how they were slowly choked out and overrun by the Kudzu

## Crafting something physical
I sort of want to make like a physical file of information that represents research given to the player at the start of the game and that they might acquire or build up as they play.  For instance:
- perhaps they know that something is up with the planet because there's an excess of oxygen in the atmosphere and almost no carbon monoxide
  - maybe this also even explains why you burn up so much area when you land, because the air is so combustible because of this
  - this would also be one of many clues that this mega-plant creature cannot sustain what it's doing to the planet: there's no longer animals producing carbon monoxide for it to breathe, it's dependent on what little some micro-organisms can do (very slowly) and perhaps areas of volcanic activity
- while exploring the planet, the player character takes notes and finds and preserves thngs from the dead society in a physical journal
- Another issue you discover and document is that there are huge swathes of the plant that its forced itself to choke off and kill in order to return nutrients to the soil to use to continue to fuel it (plants need sunlight, water, AND important broken down materials in the soilL)
  - with all other life forms dead, only micro-organisms are left to do the work of breaking down those dead pieces into nutrient soil - like here on earth, worms do a LOT of work of breaking down nutrients into the soil and without them the process is infinitely more difficult and takes much longer.
    - also this all means this dumb fucker is literally eating itself in order to survive at this point
- then also research notes, images, etc. of learning about the history of the planet and getting their hands on ephemera from the extinct species make up bits and pieces of the journal

## So, where's the horror?
It's mostly coming from the initial issues with battling back these plant life forms that grow so fast you can barely control them long enough to keep yourself alive.  After you begin to establish a better footing, it's coming to the realization over time that's it's one super-entity that's swallowed the entire planet and desperate to swallow you - a foreign invader with precious new resources for the starved and suffocated plant to devour.  Also exploring and learning about the life that's been snuffed out - perhaps there are large areas of liminal space where people used to exist that are now just eerily empty and devoid of life, evidence from a once flourishing society that's been killed off in a way similar to how humans killed the Earth.  It's also grappling with the other remnants of the Earthlings that you must communicate and coordinate with and learning about how we did something similar: killed our planet, threatening our own extinction in the process so we've had to become this extremely regimented society that has strict authoritarian control because individuals are no longer trusted to do what's right and those in charge now have a choke-hold on power.  The player has been given unprecidented freedom and control over this mission that ultimately gives them the opportunity to fight back against the fascist tendency to have crushing control over everything.
